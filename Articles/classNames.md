# What the Variable?!: The importance of naming things
We all know how it goes. You're introduced to programming languages and try to start your own projects. Naming the files and naming the variables as well as classes relate to yourself and you know what they mean, but once you start working on a project as a team, no one is going to understand what `.something` or `.div-two` means. It's that moment that you realize how important it is to name your files, classes, and variables.

## Why does it matter?
The only other audience that reads your codes is other programmers who need to understand your code and maintain it in the future. This means a lot of people can and will see this code. Aside from that, working in teams might make it more difficult to work with each other if everyone is naming things without any groundrules. This might cause a project to become slowly more difficult and more annoying to work on.

### Use naming conventions of the programming languages being used.
Capitalization, multiple word names syntax, and the general language conventions for programming languages like classes, should be followed.

### Avoid differentiating identifiers with number suffices.
Number suffixes don’t add meaningful distinction between variables with the same base name. So `fieldset-login` would be more convenient than `.fieldset-1`

### Fully spell out dictionary words, with correct spelling.
Abbreviated or incorrectly spelled words, even when used repeatedly can cause confusion and inconsistencies. They also make searching for uses of specific words difficult. (like `mod` — it could mean module, modulus, mode, modal, model, modem, or modality). You might know what the abbreviation means, but a lot of programmers won’t. Saving a few characters isn’t worth the confusion that an abbreviation might bring.

### Name constant values.
Give each constant value a name, specifically for what it represents, not just for the value it holds. (WaterBoilingPointCelcius instead of 100 orOneHundred; DaysPerWeek instead of 7 or Seven).
