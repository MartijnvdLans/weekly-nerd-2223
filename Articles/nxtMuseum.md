# Nxt Museum: Foreign Nature
On May 15th, we went to the Nxt Museum to walk around and see the endless possibilities of development and Design. There were a lot of great artworks that involved the development, like the light that projects you in it, the room with an artsy video game, and a room with AR clothing. But the one I found most fascinating was the Foreign Nature. When going into the room we see a huge projection which I was drawn into right away. There were a l

## Technical Analysis
Foreign Nature is the mathematical artwork of Julius Horsthuis. He employs computer-generated fractals to make his art. Fractals are the result of various mathematical formulas Julius visualizes them using Mandelbulb3D. These shapes are natural objects which are self-similar. Whether you zoom them in or out, the code defines them to recreate the whole.

## Design Analysis 
Foreign Nature is a projection set in a big room. The design projects on three walls and 1 floor create an illusion of being in the design. There isn’t really an interactive aspect in this design other than walking in it. There are a few projectors on the ceiling that emit the design.

## Reflection
I really enjoyed this exhibition. It was the only one, with the AR clothes and Light projection I actually enjoyed. The one thing I missed about this exhibition was the fact that it was not a 360° but missed 1 wall, cause this would have made the exhibition even more immersive in my opinion. What I love about this exhibition is that it makes use of Mathematical Fractals to display shapes and objects. I think this type of exhibition could be used at techno/Reggae festivals for people to enjoy the visuals. Other than that I sadly can't think of another use for it.
